    "# Generative Adverserial Networks in mlpack\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks are used mainly for supervised learning: classification or regression. Generative Adverserial Networks or GANs, however, use neural networks for a very different purpose: Generative modeling\n",
    "\n",
    ">A generative adversarial network is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. [Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj0oN6n3LXyAhVYIbcAHROSDhQQmhMwKnoECEAQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGenerative_adversarial_network&usg=AOvVaw09mLp9-GvBO7o23-xIW29P/)\n",

    "While there are many approaches used for generative modeling, a Generative Adverserial Network takes the following approach: \n",

    "![GAN Flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/6NMdO9u.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two neural networks: a *Generator* and a *Discriminator*. The generator generates a \"fake\" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is \"real\" (picked from the training data) or \"fake\" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs. This rather simple approach can lead to some astounding results. The following images ([source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/resources-for-getting-started-with-generative-adversarial-networks/)), for instances, were all generated using GANs:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs however, can be notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization. In this tutorial, we'll train a GAN to generate images of handwritten digits similar to those from the MNIST database.\n",
