# mlpack's - Model Zoo

mlpack features some fast implementations of state-of-the-art methods that can be applied to problems ranging from simple regression to large-scale classification, to speech and robotics applications. Several executables are packaged with mlpack meant to provide a simple way to use the method. However, sometimes it takes some time to evaluate a model on a large dataset or it's not that obvious how to use a specific method in a meaningful way to solve problem x. Maybe someone just likes to reuse an already trained model for another problem, etc. So this repository shares some interesting models and also provide:

* Step by step instructions on how to use the trained model
* A standard and simple way to download the trained model
* References to any other applicable docs or arxiv papers the model is based on
